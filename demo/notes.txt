Why do we need kNN?

1. What is kNN?

+ kNN - K nearest Neighbors, is one of the simples Supervised machine Learning algorithm mostly use for Classification

+ It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified

+ Knn stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure


2. How we choose the factor "k"?

+ kNN Algorithm is based on feature similarity: Choosing the right value of k is a process called parameter tuning, and is important for better accuraacy

+ T choose a value of k:
    -> Sqrt(n), where n is the total number of data points
    -> Odd value of k is selected to avoid confusion between two classes of data
    

3. When do we use kNN?

+ We 

How does kNN Algorithm work?

Use Case: Predict whether a person will have diabetes or not.
