Why do we need kNN?

1. What is kNN?

+ kNN - K nearest Neighbors, is one of the simples Supervised machine Learning algorithm mostly use for Classification

+ It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified

+ Knn stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure


2. How we choose the factor "k"?

+ kNN Algorithm is based on feature similarity: Choosing the right value of k is a process called parameter tuning, and is important for better accuraacy

+ T choose a value of k:
    -> Sqrt(n), where n is the total number of data points
    -> Odd value of k is selected to avoid confusion between two classes of data
    

3. When do we use kNN?

+ We can use kNN when:
    -> data is labeled
    -> data is noise free
    -> dataset is small (becouse kNN is a 'lazy learner' i.e. doesn't learn a discriminative function from the training set


4. How does kNN Algorithm work?

+ Consider a dataset having two variables: height and weight and each point is classified as Normal or Underweight

Weight  Height(y2) Class
51      167        Underweight
62      182        Normal
69      176        Normal
64      173        Normal
65      172        Normal
56      174        Underweight

On the basis of the giver data we have to classify the below set as Normal or Underweight using kNN.

+ According to the Euclidean distance formula, the distance between two points in the plane with coordinates (x,y) and (a,b) is given by:
    -> dist(d) = sqrt((x-a)**2 + (y-b)**2)  


Use Case: Predict whether a person will have diabetes or not.
